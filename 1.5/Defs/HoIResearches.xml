		<description>An Autogun is a fully automatic Auto Weapon that fires solid-slug ballistic rounds at the intended target in rapid succession. Cheap, rugged and reliable, it can be found throughout the Imperium of Man, where it is appreciated for its decent damage and accuracy. Its main drawbacks are its weight and the need to carry a large amount of cumbersome ammunition for prolonged operations. The latter drawback has led to the Astra Militarum being equipped with Lasguns as its standard armament since the early 32nd Millennium.</description>
