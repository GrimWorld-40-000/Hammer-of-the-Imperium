    <titleShort>Augmented</titleShort>  
    <baseDesc>[PawnName] has fallen under a Space Marine Chapter that values artificial enhancement and eventual replacement of limbs or other parts of the body with cybernetics. Generally the core remains, but arms and legs may be removed and replaced with master crafted works of artistry, worthy of the same admiration any other Marine deserves. This augmentation also comes with great experience in mechanics and building which [PawnName] puts to use.</baseDesc>
