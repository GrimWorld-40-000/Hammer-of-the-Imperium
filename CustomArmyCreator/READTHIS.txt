Ok so uhhhhh not sure were to start! I create all my assets in Raster, sorry Vector gang. If you are inexperianced and want a quick-color in method, use the blanks, sorry
no kasrkin png, long story short; I changed method of the mod and it was originally going to be a group project and we planned an attachment system but I left that behind, so
you will have to use the CSP files to create a kasrkin with pouches yourself, Im too busy to spend more time on a mod thats technically finished.


TO COLOR IN PNGS aka the BLANKS FOLDER
No joke this shit works like a coloring book, you cannot color over black lines with this method, use literally any art program you have at your disposal and create a NEW LAYER,
set it to MULTIPLY, color away. Like I mentioned, its a coloring book method, aslong as the PNG is white before hand, multiply will just color it in, shading included. Add
your imperial symbols on afterwards and you should be good to roll. Enjoy!
